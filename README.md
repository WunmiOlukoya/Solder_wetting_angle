# Solder_wetting_angle
Wetting angle from Misura hot stage 

Aim: 
To get a robust method for finding the wetting angle of solder on mettalic substrates. 

Challenges:

Unlike water wetting on metals , there is a reaction between the solder and substrate.

This means the extremeties of the drop - exponent from the substrate .

The flatness of droplet on the substrate.


Idea:

Get outline of droplet on solder 

Find where the edge of the solder drop on the right hand side 

Draw a line that is along the substrate - to orienatate the solder /flatness

Find interseactions:
  First intersection x pixels from origin 
  Second intersetion y pixels from origin 

Get the angle between the measurements
